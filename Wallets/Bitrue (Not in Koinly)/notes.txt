What the data shows

Koinly ledger withdrawals (2021-03-15)

Several withdrawals of XDC from your Ledger wallet to Bitrue:

39,347.27 XDC

1,000 XDC

1,000 XDC

The description already notes:

“Sent to Bitrue as it was the only wallet that would trade XDC pairs…”

These are outbound transfers from your Ledger to Bitrue.

Bitrue deposit history (2021-04-13 / 14)

40,147.27 XDC deposit

800 XDC deposit

The large 39k withdrawal + one of the 1k withdrawals line up closely (≈40,347 XDC). Bitrue shows a net deposit of ~40,147 XDC — about 200 XDC less, likely due to:

Fees,

A missing/mis-timed deposit record, or

A small portion withdrawn again soon after.

The 800 XDC deposit corresponds roughly to the other 1,000 XDC withdrawal. Again, there’s a ~200 XDC discrepancy.

➝ This is why your numbers don’t “add up”: the amounts don’t match one-for-one, but they’re within a small range. Bitrue may have aggregated deposits, deducted fees, or handled rounding differently.

Bitrue trades
Once the XDC hit Bitrue, you traded it into other currencies:

On 2021-05-10, you sold 40,947.2 XDC for ~3,923 USDT.

This matches the inflow of ~40k XDC from Ledger to Bitrue a few weeks earlier.

➝ So the lifecycle is: Ledger → Bitrue deposit (≈40k XDC) → Sell for USDT.

How to annotate in Koinly

For each withdrawal from Ledger to Bitrue:

Append note like:
GPT Says: Sent to Bitrue wallet for trading XDC pairs. Corresponds to Bitrue deposit(s) of ~40,147 XDC (Apr 2021). Later sold on Bitrue for ~3,923 USDT.

For the discrepancy (1000 vs 800, 39k vs 40,147):

Explain as:
Slight mismatch between Ledger withdrawal and Bitrue deposit records (~200 XDC difference), likely due to fees or Bitrue recording conventions.
